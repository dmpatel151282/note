In the Package
--------------
testcases/*
    Contains all tests that run under the LTP as well as the "bin"
    directory, which has hardlinks to all the test executables.

runtest/*
    It houses command lists that are used by ltp-pan for automated testing.

pan/*
    The pan directory contains a simple, lightweight test harness.  lpt-pan
    has the ability to run tests randomly and in parallel.See ltp-pan's man 
    page for more information.

scratch/*
    The scratch directory is a dumping ground for snippets and test cases
    that we found but haven't integrated into LTP yet.  Feel free to suggest
    new snippets to be added, or take one of these and finish it off.
